# CMPE544 Project - Implementing and extending an article

This is an implementation of a published deep neural network model used for hiding images within other images [^1] and its extension to compressing GIFs. This was a project I made with classmate OÄŸuzcan Nas for Pattern Recognition class. You can see the PDF file for the report and the IPYNB file for the code.
